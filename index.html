    <h2>Inspiration</h2>
    <p>I love the  Legend of Zelda Games. So, when we were tasked to 3D render a fruit bowl in Bleder, with any sort of creative aspect we desired, I decided to give it a twist by making the famous cooking pot in Zelda.
<br> <br>
Given that you can cook fruit in it as well, it still be considered a fruit bowl.... right?</p>

    <h2>The Ingredients:
</h2>
    <p> After settling on a concept, it was time to decide what elements I needed to 3D model besides the bowl and the wood.   My choice was based on what items are classic and commonly found in the Zelda world.
      <br> <br>
Even though the Hylian Mushroom is not a fruit, it is an easily recognisable object that makes the concept identifiable.</p>

  <h4> The 3D models </h4>
   <div class="textp">
   <p>     All of the 3D models made in this project were made in Blender by  me. Given that it was not required to add textures or  shading, I left the shapes as they were
     In order to make the design more recognisable, I made the elements fall into the bowl just as they do in the game.</p> </div>
